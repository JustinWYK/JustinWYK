# Introduction
#### Hi, I am Justin Yeung.  I was born in Hong Kong and I'm still living in it. I am currently studying at Wah Yan Kowloon.



## My coding journey
#### I first started coding when I was trying to make a simple discord bot. That time, I was trying to find a tutorial that looked easy. After watching many tutorials with many failed attempts and errors, I learned the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. I was using discord.js and created many bots that didn't have much purpose but then, I created BlueBot. For more information about BlueBot, click [here](https://github.com/JustinWYK/BlueBot)
